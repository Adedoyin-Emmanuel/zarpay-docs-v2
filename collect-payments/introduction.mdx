## Overview
ZarPay provides various options for you to accept payments as a business.

## If you're building a website or app

- **[Hosted Pay](/collect-payments/hosted-pay)** - Similar to Flutterwave Standard, call our API on your server to get a payment link, redirect your customer to the link, and we'll redirect back to you when payment is done.
- **[Direct Integration](#direct-integration)** - Our mostly client-side integration. Include the JavaScript library in your checkout page and connect it to your payment button. When the customer clicks your payment button, we'll take over and redirect to you when the payment is done.

## If you're using a CMS

If you're using an eCommerce CMS like WordPress, WooCommerce, or Joomla!, we've got [plugins](/collect-payments/plugins) for those.

## You don't even need a website

If you don't have a website or don't want to deal with any code, that's fine too. We've got you covered:

- **[Payment Links](/collect-payments/payment-links)** - Easily send your customers a link for them to make a payment.
