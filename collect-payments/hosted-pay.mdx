## Introduction: Hosted Pay
Hosted Pay is our Server to Server based Payment integration. 



## How it Works
1. From your app (Server or Client), call our Initiate payment endpoint with the payment details and your API Client Id.
2. We'll return to you a link to a payment page on our server. Redirect your customers to this link to make the payment.
3. When the transaction is completed, we'll redirect the customer back to you.
